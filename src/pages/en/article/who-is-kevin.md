## A great question

Who is Kevin? A question that always happens in the interviews, that we don't like to answer, but that, in fact, we should answer; not only for others, but for ourselves.

## Then, who is Kevin?

I, Kevin, am a curious and dedicated person, studying Information Systems Engineering and Industrial Engineering. I enjoy figuring out how things work and always seek to learn and grow. I thrive in collaborative environments and have experience in frontend development, and I have 3+ years of experience in the world of programming.

On my own time, I like exercising in the gym and trekking, writing on my blog, and spending time with my friends.

I seek to contribute to a team, improve continuously and contribute my skills and experiences to the growth and success of the company.
