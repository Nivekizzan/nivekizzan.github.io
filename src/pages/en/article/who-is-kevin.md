## A great question

¿Quién es Kevin? Una pregunta que siempre se hace en las entrevistas, que no nos gusta responder, pero que, sin embargo, deberíamos responder; no unicamente para los demás, sino para nosotros mismos.

## Then, who is Kevin?

I, Kevin, am a dedicated and curious individual studying Information Systems Engineering and Industrial Engineering. I have a passion for understanding how things work and a strong drive to continuously learn and grow. I enjoy working in collaborative environments and have experience in frontend development.

In my free time, I explore new technologies, write for my blog, go to the gym, and spend time with friends. These activities help me maintain a balanced lifestyle and keep me motivated. I value integrity, continuous improvement, and teamwork, and I believe these qualities help me contribute meaningfully to any team. I'm looking forward to bringing my skills and experiences to the table and contributing to the success of the team, and therefore, the company’s success.
